## Features Implemented
Semantic HTML5:  Uses proper tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and structure[cite: 39].
-  Responsive Layout: 
  - CSS Flexbox:  Used for the navigation bar, hero section alignment, and footer[cite: 50].
  - [ CSS Grid:  Used for the "Features" and "Pricing" card layouts to ensure they stack correctly on different screens[cite: 50].
- Interactive Elements:
  - Hover effects on navigation links, buttons, and feature cards[cite: 56].
  - A keyframe animation (fade-in) on the Hero section text[cite: 56].
-  Forms:  A styled contact form with validation placeholders[cite: 47].

## Technical Details

### Breakpoints & Responsiveness
The design is mobile-first friendly and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Media Queries[cite: 53]:
1.   Desktop (Default):  Displays a multi-column grid and a split-screen hero section.
2.   Mobile (max-width: 768px):  - The navigation menu stacks vertically.
    - The grid layout switches to a single column.
    - The hero section stacks the text and image for better readability.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- Google Fonts / System Fonts
- Unsplash (Images) & Flaticon (Icons)
