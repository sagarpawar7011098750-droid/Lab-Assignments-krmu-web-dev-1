# Lab 3: Responsive Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Description
This project is a one-page responsive portfolio website designed for  Web Dev I Lab Assignment 3 [cite: 1, 3]. [cite_start]The objective was to enhance a previous portfolio design by incorporating modern CSS techniques, including  Flexbox ,  CSS Grid ,  Media Queries , and  Animations [cite: 6, 12].

The website serves as a personal portfolio for  Sagar Pawar , showcasing technical skills, projects, and contact information in a polished and professional layout[cite: 24].

## Features Implemented
* -Flexbox Layout:  Used in the  Header  (for navigation alignment) and  Hero Section  (to align the profile image and intro text side-by-side)[cite: 30].
* -CSS Grid Layout:  Applied to the  Skills  and  Projects  sections to organize content into responsive cards that adjust automatically based on screen width[cite: 33].
* -Responsive Design:  The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) using Media Queries[cite: 8, 35].
* -CSS Animations:  Includes a color-changing keyframe animation on the "Hero" text and hover effects on buttons and cards for better interactivity[cite: 46, 48].
* -Relative Units:  Utilized `rem`, `%`, and `vh` instead of fixed pixels to ensure scalability[cite: 38].

## Technologies Used
*  HTML5  (Semantic Structure)
*  CSS3  (Flexbox, Grid, Keyframes, Media Queries)

## Responsive Behavior & Testing
This website follows a  Mobile-First  approach and has been tested at the following breakpoints[cite: 72]:

*  Desktop View (> 768px): 
    * The Navigation bar displays links horizontally.
    * The Hero section displays the text on the left and the profile image on the right.
    * Skills and Projects are displayed in a grid with multiple columns.

*  Mobile/Tablet View (max-width: 768px): 
    * The Navigation bar stacks vertically for easier touch access.
    * The Hero section stacks (image and text vertically aligned).
    * The Grid layout adjusts to fewer columns or a single column to fit narrower screens[cite: 64].
